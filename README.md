A social interaction simulator to show fake news spreading mechanisms.

This is a Mac-compatible playground. 
I'm not sure if it'll run on an iPad with the "Swift playgrounds" app, and if you find it does (or doesn't) please submit a pull request.

All the instructions are inside the first page of the playground.

It is licensed under the MIT license you can find in the "LICENSE" file.
